# GUO
It's a funny mischievous application
# How to use it?
you had better copy it into your u disk
you need run Guo.exe on your "best" friend's computer and shut off the computer,then you can imagine how suprised he will be
it will copy 100 document on his desktop when the computer start up,yes 100 document and it will do it again if he restart his computer
# How to recover it?
you can delete Guo.exe and main.exe on C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup or open task manager forbidden them
also you can run recover.exe to recover his computer
ps:I put also put python document there that you can revise it according to your friendship with your friend but it may cause recover.exe be useless

这是一个用于恶搞朋友的程序
# 使用方法
你最好把它们拷贝到U盘上
你只需要运行Guo.exe 在你的好朋友的电脑上然后关机伪装案发现场，接下来你就可以想象你朋友打开电脑是的表情了
当你朋友开机时，将会有100个文件复制在他的桌面上，并且接下来的每次开机都会是如此
#如何恢复
你可以在C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup中删除main.exe和GUO.exe或者在任务管理器中禁用它们
你也可以直接运行recover.exe来直接恢复
ps:我也把py文件放进去了，你可以根据你和朋友之间的友谊进行修改，当这会让recover.exe失效
